10ThemeFor11 is an `.msstyles` theme for Windows 11 that aims to provide accurate Windows 10 controls, to the greatest extent that Windows 11 allows.

# Installation

Currently, no theme file for easy install is provided. You can download the latest `10ThemeFor11.msstyles` file from the repository and manually place it in the themes folder for now.

### Recommendations

I recommend using the _Disable Rounded Corners on Windows 11_ Windhawk mod. As most Windows 10 controls have sharp corners, having rounded windows can look strange.

### Why not use the stock Windows 10 `aero.msstyles` file?

While the stock Windows 10 `.msstyles` theme works on Windows 11, it is only partially compatible. For example, the context menus and animations are broken. 10ThemeFor11 uses the assets from the stock Windows 10 `.msstyles` but reformats them in the way Windows 11 expects.
