10ThemeFor11 is an msstyles theme for Windows 11 that aims to provide accurate Windows 10 controls to the greatest extent that Windows 11 allows.

# Installation

Currently, no theme file for easy install is provided. You can download the latest `10ThemeFor11.msstyles` file from the repository and put it in the themes folder manually for now.

I recommend using the _Disable Rounded Corners on Windows 11_ Windhawk mod. As most Windows 10 controls have sharp corners, having rounded windows can look strange.
